previous pointed shafts are known , but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows .Shooting sports is a collective group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy , precision and speed in using various types of ranged weapons , mainly referring to man-portable guns (firearms and airguns , in forms such as handguns , rifles and shotguns) and bows/crossbows .These novelty forms of archery are generally regarded as amusements , and , as such , are not governed by organizationally-sanctioned rules .The oldest bows known so far come from the Holmegård swamp in Denmark .The bow and arrow seems to have been invented in the later Paleolithic or early Mesolithic periods .Like the other events in field archery , the archers in the broadhead round go from station to station to shoot from various distances and in unique circumstances; some stations may even employ a moving target .Many are decorated with carved or engraved animals , and the most usual explanation of their use is that they were used for straightening spears and arrows , and as spear-throwers .While they may seem to imply specific disciplines (e.g .The most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle , lozenge , or leaf .The World Archery Federation (WA , also and formerly known as FITA from the French "Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc") is the governing body of the sport of archery .Its seven founding member states were France , Czechoslovakia , Sweden , Poland , the United States , Hungary , and Italy .The manga series "Rurouni Kenshin" features a large cast of fictional characters created by Nobuhiro Watsuki ."Dhanurveda" derives from the words for bow (') and knowledge (') , the “science of archery” in Puranic literature , later applied to martial arts in general .During his stay in Tokyo , Kenshin befriends new people including Myōjin Yahiko , a young child descendant from a samurai family who starts training under Kaoru , Sagara Sanosuke , a former Sekihō who enjoys fighting , and Takani Megumi , a doctor involved with the illegal drug trade .Olympic rules are derived from the WA rules .Historically , archery has been used for hunting and combat .The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the in the north of Hamburg , Germany and dates from the late Paleolithic , about 10,000–9000 BC .archery , armed combat) , by Classical times they were used generically for all fighting systems .Sanand Salil Mitra (born May 5 , 1983) is the proprietor and owner of VAYAM -Visionaries & Entrepreneurs , an Indian archery pioneer organization .Modern competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances .Common modern ball throwers (molded plastic shafts used for throwing tennis balls for dogs to fetch) use the same principle .Set in Japan during the Meiji period , several of the characters are real historical figures who interact with the fictional characters .Weapons also serve many other purposes in society including use in sports , collections for display , and historical displays and demonstrations .Major innovations in the history of weapons have included the adoption of different materials – from stone and wood to different metals , and modern synthetic materials such as plastics – and the developments of different weapon styles either to fit the terrain or to support or counteract different battlefield tactics and defensive equipment .Among the most common terms today , "śastra-vidyā" , is a compound of the words ' (weapon) and ' (knowledge) .A variety of terms are used for the English phrases “Indian martial arts” , usually deriving from Sanskrit or Dravidian sources .The World Archery Federation (WA , also and formerly known as FITA from the French "Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc") , composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations , is the governing body recognized by the International Olympic Committee .The spear-thrower is held in one hand , gripped near the end farthest from the cup .WA is the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) recognized governing body for all of archery .Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment , shooting distances , targets , time limits and degrees of athleticism involved .The name "bâtons de commandement" was the name first applied to the class of artifacts , but it makes an assumption of function; the name "bâton percé" , meaning "pierced rod" , or "perforated baton" (the term used by the British Museum) is a more recent term , and is descriptive of form rather than any presumed function .This extra length allows the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance , thus imparting more energy and ultimately higher speeds .Humans have used weapons in warfare , hunting , self-defence , law enforcement , and criminal activity for thousands of years .The dart is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist .A spear-thrower or atlatl ( It may consist of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the dart .The spear-thrower is a low-mass , fast-moving extension of the throwing arm , increasing the length of the lever .The heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges .A variant of the animal round , a broadhead round features archers shooting broadhead-tipped arrows through various single-sheet , 2-D cardboard cutouts of animals that are hung between two wooden poles , strung in the air by bendable wire , with a large dirt mound behind it as a backstop .It is composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations , and is recognised by the International Olympic Committee .Indian martial arts refers to the fighting systems of the Indian subcontinent .A spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft , usually of wood , with a pointed head .It is based in Lausanne , Switzerland .The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever .The word comes from the Latin "arcus" .	8

I suppose so . I'm not terribly familiar with other psychological concepts , so I might have to defer to them !	They mentioned various motivational theories .	According to Maehr and Meyer , "Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are."He studied under one of the founders of modern psychology , Wilhelm Wundt , and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America , at the University of California , Berkeley .It examines how emotions , attitudes and preferences affect buying behaviour .Motivation is the reason for people's actions , desires , and needs .It is an academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that , when taken together , seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains , and all the variety of epiphenomena they manifest .In February , a series of tornadoes caused 42 fatalities in Florida .The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others .Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior , while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors .The 1998 tornado season saw record numbers of tornadoes and also the most fatalities since 1974 (surpassed in 2011) .Motivation theories can be classified on a number of bases: Motivation as a desire to perform an action is usually defined as having two parts , directional such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one , as well as the activated "seeking phase" and consummatory "liking phase" .Positive psychology is concerned with eudaimonia , "the good life" or flourishing , living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life .A number of tornado events resulted in large loss of life .A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way , or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior .Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes , however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today .Central theories are Diener's tripartite model of subjective well-being , Ryff's Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being , Corey Keyes' work on flourishing , and Seligmann's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on "authentic happiness" and P.E.R.M.A .Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions , mostly by students of Freud such as Alfred Adler and Carl Gustav Jung , and by neo-Freudians such as Erich Fromm , Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan .The subjects include thinkers , social reformers , politicians , poets , essayists , and novelists , many of whom Hazlitt was personally acquainted with or had encountered .Ethnomusicology is the study of music from the cultural and social aspects of the people who make it .Stratton's studies on binocular vision inspired many later studies on the subject .Activated "seeking" behavior , such as locomotor activity , is influenced by dopaminergic drugs , and microdialysis experiments reveal that dopamine is released during the anticipation of a reward .Consumer behaviour emerged in the 1940s and 50s as a distinct sub-discipline in the marketing area .By creating this laboratory he was able to establish psychology as a separate science from other topics .In 1879 , Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research at the University of Leipzig .Consumer behaviour is the study of individuals , groups , or organizations and all the activities associated with the purchase , use and disposal of goods and services , including the consumer's emotional , mental and behavioural responses that precede or follow these activities .Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind , which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders .Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation and personality that concerns people's inherent growth tendencies and innate psychological needs .Consumer behaviour is an inter-disciplinary social science that blends elements from psychology , sociology , social anthropology , ethnography , marketing and economics , especially behavioural economics .SDT focuses on the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined .This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 1998 , primarily in the United States .In this field , a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social , behavioral , or cognitive scientist .Freud first used the term "psychoanalysis" (in French) in 1896 .This marked psychology as an independent field of study .Most tornadoes form in the U.S. , although some events may take place internationally .George Malcolm Stratton (September 26 , 1865 – October 8 , 1957) was a psychologist who pioneered the study of perception in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images up and down and left and right .It is concerned with the motivation behind choices people make without external influence and interference .It encompasses distinct theoretical and methodical approaches that emphasize cultural , social , material , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts of musical behavior , instead of only its isolated sound component .Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (16 August 1832 – 31 August 1920) was a German physician , physiologist , philosopher , and professor , known today as one of the founding figures of modern psychology .He is widely regarded as the "father of experimental psychology.""Die Traumdeutung" ("The Interpretation of Dreams") , which Freud saw as his "most significant work" , appeared in November 1899 .The term "ethnomusicology" is said to have been first coined by Jaap Kunst from the Greek words ἔθνος ("ethnos" , "nation") and μουσική ("mousike" , "music") , is often defined as the anthropology or ethnography of music , or as musical anthropology .Related concepts are eudaimonia , happiness , flourishing , quality of life , contentment , and meaningful life .The "wanting behavior" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of dopamine and dopaminergic drugs in the dorsorostral nucleus accumbens and posterior ventral palladium .During its early development from comparative musicology in the 1950s , ethnomusicology was primarily oriented toward non-Western music , but for several decades has included the study of all and any musics of the world (including Western art music and popular music) from anthropological , sociological and intercultural perspectives .Psychology is the science of behavior and mind , including conscious and unconscious phenomena , as well as thought .This type of motivation has neurobiological roots in the basal ganglia , and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways .As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases .The Spirit of the Age (full title "The Spirit of the Age: Or , Contemporary Portraits") is a collection of character sketches by the early 19th century English essayist , literary critic , and social commentator William Hazlitt , portraying 25 men , mostly British , whom he believed to represent significant trends in the thought , literature , and politics of his time .Motivation is also one's direction to behavior , or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior .Wundt , who noted psychology as a science apart from philosophy and biology , was the first person ever to call himself a psychologist .Well-being is a much-studied topic in psychology , especially positive psychology .Originally appearing in English periodicals , mostly "The New Monthly Magazine" in 1824 , the essays were collected with several others written for the purpose and published in book form in 1825 .In the 1970s , research on SDT evolved from studies comparing the intrinsic and extrinsic motives , and from growing understanding of the dominant role intrinsic motivation played in an individual's behavior but it was not until the mid-1980s that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory .He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley , and the first chair of its psychology department .	9

the SCX had almost always used a shape that was slightly curved inward on the sides , typically by 7 mm compared to a straight line .On one leg the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding and on the other a shorter ski for kicking .	61
